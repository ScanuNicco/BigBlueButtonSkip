# BigBlueButtonSkip
Skips the echo test in BigBlueButton meetings.

#Features
- By default, the extension skips the echo test while displaying a loading symbol.
- In "Stealth Mode", the extension tried to skip the echo test without modifying the BigBlueButton UI in any way. You will see the echo test flash on the screen.
- Custom Background colors can be set to customize BigBlue Button. Stealth Mode does not disable custom background colors.
